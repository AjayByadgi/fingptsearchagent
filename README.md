# FinGPT-Search-Agent

Vision: This is a search agent specifically tailored towards the financial domain that can educate the user with any topic relating to finance, and direct the user towards accurate and reliable information by providing the user with the sources that the agent used to generate its response.

1. A search agent that provides financial commentary, analysis, and news on stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and other investment instruments. Will function as a place where users want to find financial related information.
2. Can provide precise answers in question-answering systems by considering the full context, outperforming traditional search engines. It's a powerful search and retrieval engine that can quickly locate relevant financial information from various sources, such as reports, filings, and databases.
3. With every generated response, it will essentially cite the sources from which it got the information from, all while ensuring that the sources that the agent pulls information from is reliable and accurate.
4. Ensure the system can accurately parse and extract data from XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) documents, which are commonly used for financial reporting.
5. Can act as a "Robo-Advisor" for users that want advice or suggestions on topics or situations.

Current Progress: 

1. Regular "ask" can see what's on the current page and give it to the model
